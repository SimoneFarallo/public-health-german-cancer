# Analysis for Public Health Project

The Big Data Public Health course provides four datasets to prepare a final project. The project involves analyzing the datasets and reporting descriptive statistics, performing record-linkage to construct an indicator for breast cancer surgery, and calculating the same indicator by hospital and education level. The project also includes estimating the association between education level and the indicator, adjusting for potential confounders through logistic regression, and analyzing the mortality of colon cancer patients. The final model is selected to evaluate the risk factors for mortality after a colon cancer diagnosis.
